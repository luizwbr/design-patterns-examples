# Abstract Factory Pattern

This example demonstrates the Abstract Factory pattern using a GUI factory that creates UI elements for different operating systems.

## Description

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. In this example, we create UI elements (buttons and checkboxes) for different operating systems (Windows and Mac).
