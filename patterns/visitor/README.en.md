# Visitor Pattern

Demonstrates the Visitor pattern using shape operations.

## Description

The Visitor pattern allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. In this example, we define different shapes (Circle, Rectangle) and implement visitors that perform operations on these shapes, such as calculating area and rendering them.
