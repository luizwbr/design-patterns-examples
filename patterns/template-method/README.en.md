# Template Method Pattern

Demonstrates the Template Method pattern using beverage preparation.

## Description

The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure. In this example, we create a template for preparing beverages (like tea and coffee) where the overall process is defined in the base class, and specific steps are implemented in the subclasses.
