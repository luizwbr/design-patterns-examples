# Adapter Pattern

This example demonstrates the Adapter pattern using a media player that can play different file formats.

## Description

The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. In this example, we have an `AudioPlayer` that natively plays MP3 files but can use adapters to play VLC and MP4 files through their specific players.
