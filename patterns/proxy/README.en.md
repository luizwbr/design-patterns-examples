# Proxy Pattern

Demonstrates the Proxy pattern using lazy-loaded images.

## Description

The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. In this example, we implement a virtual proxy for images that loads the actual image only when it is needed, optimizing resource usage and improving performance.
