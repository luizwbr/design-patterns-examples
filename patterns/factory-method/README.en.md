# Factory Method Pattern

This example demonstrates the Factory Method pattern using a vehicle factory.

## Description

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In this example, the `VehicleFactoryService` creates different types of vehicles (Car, Bike, Truck) without the client needing to know the specific class.
