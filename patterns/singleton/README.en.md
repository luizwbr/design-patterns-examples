# Singleton Pattern

This example demonstrates the Singleton pattern using a database connection service.

## Description

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In this example, the `DatabaseService` is implemented as a singleton to ensure only one database connection exists throughout the application.
