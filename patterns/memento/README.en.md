# Memento Pattern

Demonstrates the Memento pattern using text editor with undo functionality.

## Description

The Memento pattern captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to that state later, without violating encapsulation. In this example, we implement a simple text editor that allows users to type text and undo their changes by restoring previous states.
