# State Pattern

This example demonstrates the State pattern using a document workflow with different states (Draft, Review, Published).

## Description

The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. In this example, a document can be in different states and its behavior changes based on the current state.
