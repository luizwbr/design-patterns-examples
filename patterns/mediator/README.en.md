# Mediator Pattern

Demonstrates the Mediator pattern using a chat room.

## Description

The Mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. In this example, we implement a chat room where users can send messages to each other through a mediator (the chat room), which handles the communication between users.
