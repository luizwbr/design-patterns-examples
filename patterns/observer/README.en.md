# Observer Pattern

This example demonstrates the Observer pattern using a weather station with multiple displays.

## Description

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified automatically. In this example, multiple displays observe a weather station and get updated when weather data changes.
