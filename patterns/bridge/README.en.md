# Bridge Pattern

This example demonstrates the Bridge pattern using shapes and colors.

## Description

The Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. In this example, shapes (Circle, Square, Triangle) are decoupled from colors (Red, Blue, Green).
