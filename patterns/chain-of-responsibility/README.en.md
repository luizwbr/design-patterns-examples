# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Demonstrates the Chain of Responsibility pattern using a support ticket system.

## Description

The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles the request. In this example, support tickets are processed by different support levels (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3) based on their severity.
