# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Awesome Design Patterns Examples! This guide will help you quickly start learning and using design patterns with real code examples.

## ⚡ 5-Minute Quick Start

### 1. Choose a Pattern

Browse the available patterns in the `patterns/` directory:
- **Creational**: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
- **Structural**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
- **Behavioral**: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor

### 2. Pick Your Language

Each pattern is implemented in 7 languages:
- 🐹 **Go** - Simple, modern, great for learning
- 📘 **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- ☕ **Java** - Classic OOP
- 🐘 **PHP** - Web-focused
- ⚛️ **React.js** - Modern web components
- 🅰️ **AngularJS** - Legacy web framework
- 🅰️ **Angular 2+** - Modern Angular

### 3. Run Your First Example

Let's try the **Singleton pattern** in Go:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/luizwbr/awesome-design-patterns-examples.git
cd awesome-design-patterns-examples

# Navigate to Singleton pattern in Go
cd patterns/singleton/go

# Run the example
go run main.go
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Creating database instance
Executing query: SELECT * FROM users on Database connection established
Executing query: SELECT * FROM products on Database connection established
db1 and db2 are the same instance: true
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** You just ran your first design pattern example.

## 📚 Running Examples in Different Languages

### Go
```bash
cd patterns/singleton/go
go run main.go
```

### TypeScript
```bash
cd patterns/singleton/typescript
npx tsx Singleton.ts
# or compile first
tsc Singleton.ts && node Singleton.js
```

### Java
```bash
cd patterns/singleton/java
javac Singleton.java
java Singleton
```

### PHP
```bash
cd patterns/singleton/php
php Singleton.php
```

### React.js
React components are meant to be imported into a React application. See the component files for usage examples in comments.

### Angular (2+)
Angular components are meant to be used in Angular applications. Check the `.ts` files for usage examples.

## 🎯 What to Learn Next

### Understand the Pattern

Each pattern directory includes:
- **README.en.md** - English explanation
- **README.pt-br.md** - Portuguese explanation (Brazil)
- **Code examples** - Working implementations in all 7 languages

Example for Singleton:
```bash
cd patterns/singleton
cat README.en.md  # Read the explanation
```

### Try Different Patterns

**Easy to start with:**
1. **Singleton** - One instance shared everywhere
2. **Factory Method** - Create objects without specifying exact class
3. **Observer** - Subscribe to events and get notified

**More complex:**
1. **Abstract Factory** - Families of related objects
2. **Decorator** - Add behavior dynamically
3. **Strategy** - Switch algorithms at runtime

### Compare Implementations

See how the same pattern differs across languages:

```bash
# Singleton in different languages
cat patterns/singleton/go/main.go
cat patterns/singleton/typescript/Singleton.ts
cat patterns/singleton/java/Singleton.java
cat patterns/singleton/php/Singleton.php
```

## 📖 Learning Path

### Beginner (Week 1)
1. Read about what design patterns are
2. Run 3 examples: Singleton, Factory Method, Observer
3. Understand when to use each pattern

### Intermediate (Week 2-3)
1. Implement one pattern yourself in your preferred language
2. Compare your implementation with ours
3. Try 5 more patterns: Adapter, Decorator, Strategy, Command, Template Method

### Advanced (Week 4+)
1. Study complex patterns: Abstract Factory, Composite, Mediator
2. Combine multiple patterns in a project
3. Understand pattern interactions and trade-offs

## 💡 Common Use Cases

### When You Need...

**One shared instance across your app?**
→ Use **Singleton** pattern

**To create objects without knowing their exact type?**
→ Use **Factory Method** or **Abstract Factory**

**To notify multiple objects about state changes?**
→ Use **Observer** pattern

**To add features to objects without changing their code?**
→ Use **Decorator** pattern

**To simplify a complex system's interface?**
→ Use **Facade** pattern

**To switch algorithms at runtime?**
→ Use **Strategy** pattern

**To encapsulate a request as an object?**
→ Use **Command** pattern

## 🧪 Test Your Understanding

### Quick Quiz

After running examples, ask yourself:

1. **What problem does this pattern solve?**
2. **When should I use it?**
3. **What are the trade-offs?**
4. **How does it differ across languages?**

### Hands-On Exercise

Pick a pattern and:
1. Run all 7 language implementations
2. Modify one to add a new feature
3. Test your modification
4. Compare your approach with the original
