# Decorator Pattern - Angular 2+

This example demonstrates the Decorator pattern in Angular 2+ using coffee with various add-ons.

## Description

The Decorator pattern adds responsibilities to objects dynamically. In this example, we start with a simple coffee and add decorators like milk, sugar, and whipped cream.

## How It Works

1. `Coffee` is the component interface
2. `SimpleCoffee` is the concrete component
3. `CoffeeDecorator` is the base decorator
4. `MilkDecorator`, `SugarDecorator`, `WhippedCreamDecorator` are concrete decorators
